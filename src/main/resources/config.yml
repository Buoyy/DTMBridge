# MESSAGE CUSTOMIZATION
# NOTE: {player} -> player name, {adv} -> advancement name
# {msg} -> message name
# & -> colour code operator (look up Bukkit colour codes for this)
# NOTE: For '&', formatting goes before colour. Won't work otherwise.
# This means that discord-msg needs to have the bold formatting code before
# some colour code, for e.g. &l&b works. &b&l won't.
# * * -> italicised; ** ** -> bold; *** *** -> mix of both
# look up Discord formatting for more!
